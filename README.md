# Iremind — Smart Productivity Application 

## 1. Project Title & Description

-Project Name: Iremind
-What It Does: Iremind is a personal productivity website that helps users organize their daily life.
-It includes tools such as:
   Login and Sign Up system
   Dashboard
   To-Do List
   Notes page
   Calendar
   Simple user interface for easy navigation

-Why I Built It:
   I could not find a useful and simple app to track my assignments, study plans, and daily tasks. So, I decided to create my own website.
-My goal is to:
   Help users manage tasks in one place
   Make organization easier for students and busy people 
   Give motivation with a clean and aesthetic design
   Let users see their improvements day by day

## 2. Tech Stack Used

   HTML – builds the structure of each webpage
   CSS – styling, layout, colors, animations
   JavaScript – for functionality and interactivity

-Backend
   Node.js – server-side environment
   Express.js – handles routes and server logic
   Prisma ORM – connects server to the database
   Prisma Studio – used to view and edit database tables
